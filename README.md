# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with JavaScript, designed to help practice and demonstrate the use of **factory functions**.

## Project Overview

This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

The main goal of this project is to practice using **factory functions** in JavaScript to create modular, reusable, and encapsulated code.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
- Detects win and draw conditions
- Simple, clean UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Modular code using factory functions

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **Factory Functions:** Used to create player objects and manage game logic.
- **Encapsulation:** Game state and logic are kept private within factory functions.
